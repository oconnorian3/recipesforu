The overall desing is kept simple as users are encouraged to post images to go with their recipes . Research has shown that people eat with their eyes so to speak so distractions were kep to a minium.

The layout of the site is standard for a blog site with clear descriptive navigational links. 

The site features are standard and expected for a blog site. 

**Agile**

The agile approach was employed in designing and constructing this project, from the outset of planning to the completion of development. To facilitate the process, I established a GitHub project and adopted the Kanban board methodology to divide project components into user stories and feasible tasks.

For a comprehensive view of all user stories please refer to the linked project [Project Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/oconnorian3/projects/10) . Additionally, each story has been assigned a label that indicates its level of significance in the site's overall functionality and acceptance.

## Development Planes ##

In order to develop an engaging and all-encompassing website, I conducted research on other food-related websites. This enabled me to identify and incorporate appropriate features and functionalities that aligned with my project, as well as determine a suitable color palette for the project.

## Strategy ##

**Site Goals**

The primary objective for the website was to establish a platform that users could effortlessly navigate and engage with, not only to upload their own recipes but also to interact with other members. My vision was to build a community where individuals could freely submit their favorite recipes and explore new ones.

The website caters to the following target groups:

* User Roles:
    * Standard User
    * Administrator

* Demographics:
    * Individuals passionate about food
    * Those seeking to broaden their culinary horizons
    * Cooking enthusiasts     

* The website must provide the user with the ability to:
    * Browse through recipes
    * Register and establish their account
    * Create and upload their own recipes
    * Like and comment on recipes
    * Fill out a contact form

* The website must provide the admin with the ability to:
    * Approve comments    
    * Filter through recipes, comments, and users to manage the site effectively    

## Scope ##

This section outlines the functions and features included in the project scope. The project was designed with minimal functionality in mind, which means that most of the features included are basic requirements. For instance, user sign up and login functionality had to be implemented, along with basic CRUD operations for authenticated users. For a detailed explanation of all the existing features, please refer to the Existing Features **Add Link** section. The Future Features section discusses potential features that were deemed unnecessary at this point in time, despite being within the project's possible scope.

## Structure ##

 The site's layout is based on a simple blog design that is commonly used by many other blogs online. With this structure, users can easily access the site, browse receipes , leave a message and login/register so they can upload their own recipes and comment on other recipes.
