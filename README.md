<br>

This Django project is a reccipe sharing blog intended for food lovers where users can upload, comment and like other recipes. Users can also view recipes posted by other users which they can try. Like a regular blog only registered users can post, comment on or like other recipies . Registered users will also have the ability to edit or remove their previous posts. 

## Post responsive images here

## UI/UX ##

The overall desing is kept simple as users are encouraged to post images to go with their recipes . Research has shown that people eat with their eyes so to speak so distractions were kep to a minium.

The layout of the site is standard for a blog site with clear descriptive navigational links. 

The site features are standard and expected for a blog site. 

**Agile**

The agile approach was employed in designing and constructing this project, from the outset of planning to the completion of development. To facilitate the process, I established a GitHub project and adopted the Kanban board methodology to divide project components into user stories and feasible tasks.

For a comprehensive view of all user stories please refer to the linked project [Project Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/oconnorian3/projects/10) . Additionally, each story has been assigned a label that indicates its level of significance in the site's overall functionality and acceptance.

**Wireframe**

Below are some basic Wireframes done up before the project started.
